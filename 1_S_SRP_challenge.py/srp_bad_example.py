SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE

Notice that in this class, we have multiple actions and responsibilities, which makes maintenance, usability, and even performance poor.

Following the Single Responsibility Principle, organize this class and, if necessary, create other classes with their respective responsibilities.
